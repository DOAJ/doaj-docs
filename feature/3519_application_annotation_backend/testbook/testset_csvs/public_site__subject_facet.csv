BI.1.2.,anonymous,Select a subject from the subject facet (e.g. Agriculture),
BI.1.2.1.,anonymous,,The subject is selected in the facet
BI.1.2.2.,anonymous,,The subject's children are now visible in the subject facet
BI.1.2.3.,anonymous,,All other top level subjects are still visible in the subject facet
BI.1.2.4.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the subject you selected"
BI.1.2.5.,anonymous,,The search results reflect your subject selection
BI.1.2.6.,anonymous,,The number of subjects changes in the Subject Search box above.

BI.1.7.,anonymous,"Unselect the second level subject, directly above the subject you just selected (e.g. Animal Culture)",
BI.1.7.1.,anonymous,,"That subject is no longer selected in the facet, and neither are its children"
BI.1.7.2.,anonymous,,The parent subject (1 layer) is still selected (e.g. Agriculture)
BI.1.7.3.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the new lowest level subject selected (e.g. Agriculture)"
BI.1.7.4.,anonymous,,The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
