## BK.1,----------,## Test Exploring the Subject Tree,----------
BK.1.1.,anonymous,Go to the DOAJ journal search page at /search/journals,
BK.1.2.,anonymous,Select a subject from the subject facet (e.g. Agriculture),
BK.1.2.1.,anonymous,,The subject is selected in the facet
BK.1.2.2.,anonymous,,The subject's children are now visible in the subject facet
BK.1.2.3.,anonymous,,All other top level subjects are still visible in the subject facet
BK.1.2.4.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the subject you selected"
BK.1.2.5.,anonymous,,The search results reflect your subject selection
BK.1.2.6.,anonymous,,The number of subjects changes in the Subject Search box above.
BK.1.3.,anonymous,Select a subject from the second level of subjects (e.g. Animal Culture),
BK.1.3.1.,anonymous,,The subject is selected in the facet
BK.1.3.2.,anonymous,,The third level of subjects is now visible in the subject facet
BK.1.3.3.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the lowest level subject you have selected (e.g. Animal Culture), and no other subject filters are present"
BK.1.3.4.,anonymous,,The search results reflect your subject selection
BK.1.3.5.,anonymous,,The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased

BK.1.7.,anonymous,"Unselect the second level subject, directly above the subject you just selected (e.g. Animal Culture)",
BK.1.7.1.,anonymous,,"That subject is no longer selected in the facet, and neither are its children"
BK.1.7.2.,anonymous,,The parent subject (1 layer) is still selected (e.g. Agriculture)
BK.1.7.3.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the new lowest level subject selected (e.g. Agriculture)"
BK.1.7.4.,anonymous,,The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
BK.1.8.,anonymous,"Reselect the second and third level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture, Cattle)",

## BK.2,----------,## Multiple Subject Selection,----------
BK.2.1.,anonymous,Go to the DOAJ journal search page at /search/journals,
BK.2.2.,anonymous,Select a subject from the subject facet (e.g. Agriculture),
BK.2.3.,anonymous,Select two of the children from the second level (e.g. Forestry and Animal Culture),
BK.2.3.1.,anonymous,,Both subjects (and their parent) are selected in the facet
BK.2.3.2.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for both second level subjects you selected"
BK.2.4.,anonymous,Uselect one of the second level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture),
BK.2.4.1.,anonymous,,The other selected subject is still selected (along with its parent)
BK.2.4.2.,anonymous,,"There is a ""selected filter"" pill at the top of the search results for the only second level subject (e.g. Forestry)"
BK.2.5.,anonymous,Reselect one of the second level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture),
